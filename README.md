# Web Server Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
This project investigates web server performance, emphasizing on Round Trip Times (RTT), Time to First Byte (TTFB), and Packet Loss. It analyzes data from 35 websites at various times to identify performance variations.

## Objectives
- To explore network performance metrics.
- To provide optimization insights for better user experience.

## Methodology
- Collection and analysis of data using tools like Ping, Curl, and Wget.
- Examination of metrics at different times of the day.

## Key Findings
- Performance variations based on geographical location and time of day.
- Insights into traffic patterns and server optimizations.

## Conclusion
This analysis underscores the significance of multiple factors in web server performance optimization.
